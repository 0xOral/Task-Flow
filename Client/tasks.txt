1. Logout Cleanup:
   - After logging out, clear all localStorage/sessionStorage (tokens, user data, etc).

2. Unified Layout Components:
   - Create unified components (Header, Sidebar, Layout) for all roles.
   - Use folder structure: 
     - src/components/shared/ → shared layouts or UI parts
     - src/components/unshared/ → role-specific components

3. Persistent Login & Protected Routes:
   - Ensure user stays logged in on page refresh.
   - Prevent access to /login and /landing if user is already logged in.
   - Implement protected routing that redirects unauthorized users properly.

4. Theme & Language Toggles:
   - Add "Toggle Theme" and "Toggle Language" buttons for all roles (admin, super admin, teacher, student).
   - Place them in a reusable component and import across all POVs.

5. Pages Folder Restructure:
   - In src/pages, organize files as:
     - shared/ → pages accessible by more than one role
     - unshared/ → role-specific pages
     - General pages (e.g., login.tsx, index.tsx) stay directly in src/pages

6. Code Linting:
   - Run linter across all files.
   - Fix all warnings and errors (style, unused imports, etc).

7. Reusable UI Components:
   - Create reusable components (Table, Calendar, Pagination, etc).
   - Place them in src/components/ui/
