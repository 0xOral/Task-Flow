# TASK-FLOW LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - ROLES & INFRASTRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Task-Flow is an advanced Learning Management System (LMS) built with Next.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. It features multi-role authentication, internationalization (Arabic/English), theme switching (light/dark), and comprehensive role-based access control.

**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED - All core systems implemented and tested
- ✅ Unified Router System fully implemented
- ✅ Role-based routing with proper access control
- ✅ Theme and language persistence with localStorage
- ✅ All ESLint errors resolved
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build process working without errors

## CORE INFRASTRUCTURE CONCEPTS

### 1. UNIFIED ROUTING SYSTEM (COMPLETED)
**CRITICAL**: This system does NOT use a centralized dashboard approach. Instead, it implements a unified router that handles all navigation through role-based redirections.

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

#### Key Components (IMPLEMENTED):
- **UnifiedRouter** (`/src/components/routing/UnifiedRouter.tsx`): ✅ Handles all routing logic with authentication checks
- **Routes Configuration** (`/src/lib/routes.ts`): ✅ Defines all route mappings and role-based permissions
- **UniversalLayout** (`/src/components/layout/UniversalLayout.tsx`): ✅ Provides consistent layout across all authenticated pages

#### Routing Flow (ACTIVE):
1. User accesses any URL → ✅ Working
2. UnifiedRouter checks authentication status → ✅ Working  
3. If unauthenticated → redirect to `/login` → ✅ Working
4. If authenticated → redirect to role-specific landing page → ✅ Working
5. For subsequent navigation → validate route permissions against user role → ✅ Working
6. If unauthorized route → redirect to role's main page → ✅ Working

### 2. ROLE-BASED ARCHITECTURE (IMPLEMENTED)

**STATUS**: ✅ All role-based pages and routing completed

#### User Roles Hierarchy:
```
SUPER_ADMIN (Highest Privilege)
├── System-wide management
├── Can access all admin functions
├── Manages institutions and admins
└── Landing: /superadmin

ADMIN
├── Institution-level management  
├── User and course oversight
├── Reports and analytics
└── Landing: /admin

TEACHER
├── Course and student management
├── Assignment creation and grading
├── Class scheduling
└── Landing: /teacher

STUDENT (Basic User)
├── Course enrollment and viewing
├── Assignment submission
├── Grade viewing
└── Landing: /student
```

#### Role Permissions Matrix:
| Feature | STUDENT | TEACHER | ADMIN | SUPER_ADMIN |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| View Courses | Own | Own | All | All |
| Create Courses | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage Users | ❌ | Students Only | All | All |
| System Settings | ❌ | ❌ | Limited | Full |
| Analytics | Basic | Course-level | Institution | System-wide |

- **Dark Mode**: Dark theme for low-light environments
- **System**: Automatically follows OS preference

#### Theme Implementation (✅ WORKING):
- ✅ Uses Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- ✅ Theme state managed in Redux with automatic localStorage persistence
- ✅ Global theme provider ensures consistency across all components
- ✅ Automatic system theme detection and synchronization
- ✅ Theme switcher component integrated in navigation

### 7. DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS & BEST PRACTICES

#### Component Development:
1. **Functional Components**: Use React function components with hooks
2. **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all components and props
3. **Prop Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for component props
4. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error handling for robust UX
5. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for inclusive design

#### State Management:
1. **Redux Toolkit**: Use RTK for global state management
2. **Local State**: Use useState for component-specific state
3. **API State**: Use RTK Query for server state management
4. **Persistence**: Auto-save critical state to localStorage

#### Routing Patterns:
1. **Role-Based**: All routes are organized by user roles
2. **Protected Routes**: Authentication required for all non-public routes
3. **Permission Checking**: Validate route access based on user role
4. **Redirect Logic**: Automatic redirection to appropriate role pages

#### Styling Conventions:
1. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
2. **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
3. **Component Classes**: Reusable style patterns
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive layouts

### 8. API INTEGRATION PATTERNS

#### Authentication API:
```typescript
// Login endpoint
POST /api/auth/login
Body: { email: string, password: string }
Response: { user: User, token: string }

// Logout endpoint  
POST /api/auth/logout
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" }

// Profile endpoint
GET /api/auth/profile
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" }
Response: { user: User }
```

#### Mock Data Integration:
- Development environment uses mock authentication
- Predefined user accounts for each role
- Simulated API responses for testing

### 9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

#### Authentication Security:
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Secure localStorage handling
- CSRF protection for API calls

#### Authorization Security:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Route-level permission validation
- API endpoint authorization
- Data filtering based on user permissions

### 10. DEPLOYMENT & BUILD CONFIGURATION

#### Build Process:
1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Strict type checking
2. **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
3. **Prettier**: Code formatting
4. **Next.js Build**: Static generation and optimization
5. **Bundle Analysis**: Performance optimization

#### Environment Configuration:
- **Development**: Hot reloading, mock APIs, debug logging
- **Production**: Optimized builds, real APIs, error tracking
- **Testing**: Isolated environment, test databases

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Getting Started:
1. ✅ Clone repository and install dependencies
2. ✅ Configure environment variables  
3. ✅ Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. ✅ Access application at `http://localhost:3000` (or alternative port)

### Testing User Roles (AVAILABLE):
- ✅ Student: Login with student credentials → automatically redirected to `/student`
- ✅ Teacher: Login with teacher credentials → automatically redirected to `/teacher`  
- ✅ Admin: Login with admin credentials → automatically redirected to `/admin`
- ✅ Super Admin: Login with super admin credentials → automatically redirected to `/superadmin`

### Adding New Features:
1. Define route in `/src/lib/routes.ts` with proper role permissions
2. Create page component in appropriate role folder (`/src/pages/{role}/`)
3. Add navigation item to role's menu in `Sidebar.tsx`
4. Implement API endpoints if needed in `/src/store/api/`
5. Add translations for new content in `/src/locales/{lang}/common.json`
6. Test across all supported themes (light/dark/system) and languages (en/ar)

### Current Status Summary:
- ✅ **Build Status**: Project compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ **Linting**: All ESLint errors resolved  
- ✅ **TypeScript**: All type errors fixed
- ✅ **Routing**: Unified router system fully operational
- ✅ **Authentication**: Role-based auth working with proper redirects
- ✅ **Theming**: Light/dark/system themes with persistence
- ✅ **Internationalization**: English/Arabic with RTL support
- ✅ **State Management**: Redux store with localStorage integration
- ✅ **File Organization**: Clean role-based structure implemented

## AI DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### When Working on This Project:
1. **✅ Architecture Implemented**: The unified router system is complete and operational
2. **✅ Follow Established Patterns**: All routing, theming, and i18n patterns are implemented
3. **✅ Role Boundaries Respected**: Role-based permissions are enforced throughout
4. **✅ Consistency Maintained**: All components follow established patterns
5. **✅ Multi-Role Testing**: System works across all user roles
6. **Keep Documentation Updated**: This file should be updated when adding new features
7. **Consider Internationalization**: Add translations for new text content  
8. **Theme Compatibility**: Ensure new components work in both light and dark themes

### ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- ✅ Unified router with role-based redirections (no dashboard POV)
- ✅ Complete role-based page structure (student/teacher/admin/superadmin)
- ✅ Theme system with localStorage persistence (light/dark/system)
- ✅ Language system with localStorage persistence (en/ar with RTL)
- ✅ Redux state management with proper persistence
- ✅ Authentication system with role-based access control
- ✅ Component organization and reusability
- ✅ TypeScript type safety and ESLint compliance
- ✅ Build system optimization and error resolution

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- ❌ Creating centralized dashboard components (SOLVED: role-based pages implemented)
- ❌ Hard-coding route paths in components (SOLVED: routes configuration system)
- ❌ Mixing role-specific logic in shared components (SOLVED: clean separation)
- ❌ Ignoring internationalization requirements (SOLVED: comprehensive i18n)
- ❌ Adding non-responsive designs (SOLVED: Tailwind responsive patterns)
- ❌ Skipping TypeScript type definitions (SOLVED: strict typing throughout)
- ❌ Creating components without error handling (SOLVED: error boundaries implemented)
