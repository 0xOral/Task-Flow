# Project Prompt: Enterprise University Web Application Enhancement
#################################################################

### 1. Project Goal
The primary goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and modern "Enterprise University" theme across the web application. This involves creating a new public-facing landing page and refactoring the styles of existing key pages to match the new design system.

### 2. Technical Stack & Constraints
- **Framework:** React.js / Next.js (inferred from file structure)
- **Language:** TypeScript (`.tsx`)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is mandatory. All styling must be implemented using its utility classes.
- **Routing:** The application's routing must be updated to serve the new landing page as the default route.

### 3. General Instructions & Architecture
- **Component-Based Development:**
  - You must create modular and reusable React components for UI elements (e.g., buttons, cards, layout wrappers, navigation bars).
  - Maintain a clean and logical file structure. A suggested structure is:
    - `src/components/common/` (for buttons, inputs, etc.)
    - `src/components/layout/` (for Navbar, Footer, PageWrapper, etc.)
    - `src/components/landing/` (for sections specific to the landing page)

- **Styling & Asset Configuration:**
  - Create a central configuration for the design system.
  - In `tailwind.config.js`, define the project's theme: colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
  - Use a global CSS file (e.g., `src/styles/globals.css`) to define base styles, import fonts, and apply any necessary root-level styles.

### 4. Core Development Tasks

#### Task 1: Create the University Landing Page
- **File Creation:** Create a new file for the landing page, for instance, at `src/pages/index.tsx` or `src/pages/landing.tsx`. **Do not** modify the existing `login.tsx` to serve as the landing page.
- **Routing:** Configure the application's routing so that the root path (`/`) directs to this newly created landing page.
- **Content & Sections:** The page must be professional and representative of a high-level educational institution. You have the creative freedom to design its layout and content. Suggested sections include:
    - **Hero Section:** A powerful headline, a brief mission statement, and high-quality imagery.
    - **About Us:** A brief introduction to the university's history and values.
    - **Programs/Faculties:** A section highlighting key academic programs or departments.
    - **News & Events:** A small section for recent university news.
    - **Call to Action (CTA):** A final section encouraging users to sign in.
- **Specific Requirement:** The only primary call to action for users on this page must be a **"Sign In" button**. This button should navigate the user to the `/login` page. **Do not include a "Sign Up" or "Register" option anywhere on the landing page.**

#### Task 2: Style Existing Application Pages
- **Objective:** Refactor the styling of the following pages to ensure they are visually cohesive with the new landing page and the overall "Enterprise University" theme.
- **Target Files:**
    1. `src/pages/login.tsx`
    2. `src/pages/students/index.tsx` (The main students list/dashboard)
    3. `src/pages/students/[id].tsx` (The individual student detail page)
- **Requirement:** The styling must be seamless. A user navigating from the landing page to the login page and then to the student pages should experience a consistent and professional user interface.

### 5. Your Creative Choices (Developer's Discretion)

You are responsible for defining the specifics of the "Enterprise University" visual identity. Your choices should be guided by principles of professionalism, trust, and modernity.
- **Visual Style:** Define the overall aesthetic (e.g., modern, classic, minimalist).
- **Color Palette:** Choose a primary color (e.g., deep blue, burgundy), secondary colors, and accent colors suitable for a university.
- **Typography:** Select fonts (e.g., a serif for headings, a sans-serif for body text) and define a typographic scale for headings, paragraphs, and other text elements.
- **Landing Page Structure:** Determine the exact number, order, and content of the sections on the new landing page.
